			<b>April 14, 2020:</b><br>
			Decided on...Carnegie Mellon! Phew, that was 2 months of really hard deliberation. I'm really lucky to have these choices, and it was probably the most difficult decision of my life! In the end, it came down to advisor fit (both research fit and style fit), and where I felt I would have the most flexibility in working with different people! <br><br>

			<b>March 21, 2020:</b><br>
			Finished with Carnegie Mellon and UW visit days (gone virtual due to COVID-19). Also considering going back to Cornell! <br>
			Was surprisingly successful at giving me a feel for the schools, but I'm still undecided! I still have lots of meetings to go with faculty and current grad students, which will hopefully help the decision.
