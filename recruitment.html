    Fill out this form to express your interest in working with me at the University of Melbourne!

</p> <br>
 <p>I am recruiting several PhD students interested in human-computer interaction to start working with me at the University of Melbourne in 2026.</p>
 <p style="font-size: 18px;"><b>Why Melbourne?</b></p>
 <p>There are several reasons why doing your PhD at Melbourne might be a good fit.<br><br>
  Firstly, <b>you are fully funded</b> if you come to work with me here. 
  This is hugely important for your PhD because it means that we have much more research freedom to pursue our ideas, compared to other funding systems with different external constraints.
  <br><br>
  Second, <b>Melbourne is a top place to do HCI research</b>. It is <a href="https://csrankings.org/#/index?chi&world">ranked 11th in the world in HCI research</a> and the <a href="https://www.topuniversities.com/world-university-rankings?search=Melbourne">19th best university in the world</a>. The <a href="https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/research/hci#people">HCI Group at Melbourne</a> is very large compared to most other schools with 16+ faculty members; this means you have ample opportunity to collaborate with some of the best and brightest scholars in the field.
  <br><br>
  Third, <b>your PhD is 3.5-4 years</b> here with a much greater focus on just doing research. You will not have <i>required</i> coursework or teaching during your PhD. This could be a pro or con, depending on you.
  <br><br>
  Fourth, PhD students in Australia are generally well supported and enjoy strong work–life balance and academic freedom. Melbourne is one of the world’s most livable cities (<a href="https://www.eiu.com/n/campaigns/global-liveability-index-2025/">currently ranked 4th globally</a>), with great public transport (including free trams in the city center) and a vibrant, diverse culture.
 
</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;"><b>What kinds of students are you hiring?</b></p>
 <p>The most important things are that you: 
  <ul>
  <li><b>communicate and write well</b> and <b>have some sort of research experience</b>, even if it is unconventional or did not product strong output. This is important for being able to produce high-quality research from the start of your PhD. I will be your advisor and mentor, and as such will be helping you! I prefer if you have some level of technical background in computing or engineering.
  What I've realized over time is that simply the ability to frame, write, and present research well is <i>equally</i> as important as conducting it. I insist on having students who do not have to rely on generative models to write well.</li>
  <li><b>have good (relevant, novel, interesting, feasible, ...) ideas</b>. I want students who are creative and have high-level research thinking. I'd like students to come in having a passion and eye for good research questions, even though I certainly expect for my mentoring to include tailoring and building upon those ideas.</li>
  <li><b>are cool to work with</b>. I want to collaborate with students who are kind, trustworthy, and upstanding colleagues. The PhD is long and can be hard; it is much better when we get to have fun and supportive colleagues around :) Much of the reason I chose to come work at UniMelb is because I liked the people that I met. </li>
  </ul>
    In terms of research area, I have broad interests. My expertise is in mental health and social well-being, but I plan to expand my research to other social impact areas. <br>
    Some keywords of things that are interesting to me right now include <i>environmental connectedness, tech for professional mental healthcare contexts, low-barrier mental health intervention, embodied and wearable tech, social simulation, identity and culture, and technology-facilitated harm (particularly against women)</i>. The best thing that a student could bring is interesting and new ideas; so don't feel limited by the above list. Most anything related to technology/systems + social impact is relevant to me.
<br><br>
  <b>If you are international,</b> I am primarily hiring students who qualify for Tier-1 scholarship in Australia as this means we have immense funding freedom (& top students are likely to qualify for this anyways). However, exceptions can be made. If you are a domestic student (Aus or NZ citizen, PR) then you don't need to worry about this as the government will automatically fund your tuition.
