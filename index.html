  	<h1> Hi, I'm Anna. </h1>
  	
  	<hr />
  	<p>I am a PhD candidate at Stanford University/The University of Washington/Cornell University in <tt>Computer Science</tt>. I study <strong>social computing</strong> and <strong>human-computer interaction</strong>.
  	My research focuses on <strong>the networks of social and information systems, and how they can be leveraged to aid societal wellness as a whole</strong>.
  	<br>
	<br>
  	Some goals of my work are to understand how online communities affect offline society, improve people's mental and emotional wellbeing, study online education and collaboration, and combat algorithmic bias against disadvantaged groups. In other words, I am passionate about building computational techniques and tools that help people live healthy and fair lives in the modern digital age.</p>

    <p>Previously, I graduated magna cum laude from Cornell University in 2019 with my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and worked at Amazon as a software engineer <tt>(CV)</tt>. I love sketching and painting, filmmaking, watching movies (especially Wes Anderson), botany, coffee/tea, knitting, and being a homebody. </p>
